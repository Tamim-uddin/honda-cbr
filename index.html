              <div class="about-text">
                The Honda CBR models are a series of Honda sport bikes first introduced in 1983. With the exception of the single-cylinder CBR125R, CBR150R, CBR250R and CBR300R, all CBR motorbikes have inline engines. Less sporting/general models make up CB series2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the legendary Honda CBR900RR/Fireblade. Designed by Tadao Baba, the Blade boasted 107.5 horsepower and weighed just 4.4 pounds more than the current CBR600. That favorable power-to-weight ratio allowed the CBR900RR to dominate the competition.Over the years, Team Red made the superbike more road and user-friendly. However, in 2020, Honda returned the Fireblade to its performance roots with 214.5 horsepower, a cutting-edge electronics suite, and MotoGP-inspired winglets. With the model’s 30th anniversary on the horizon, many suspect that Honda will celebrate the occasion with a special throwback livery.Similar to the retro paint jobs donned by Kawasaki’s Superbike World Championship (WSBK) team, the CBR1000RR-R could sport a replica color scheme in 2022. While many Honda fans expect the tri-color design and brushstroke accents to return, the brand hasn’t provided any hints as of late.On the other hand, recently submitted European type-approval documents reveal that the Fireblade’s looks aren’t the only thing changing in 2022. After a disappointing return to WSBK, Honda not only switched up its rider lineup but will also tweak the CBR1000RR-R for better performance on the track.

                  <h3>Honda CBR 150R</h3>
                  <p>The Honda CBR150R is a CBR series 150 cc single-cylinder sport bike made by Honda. It is currently manufactured in Indonesia by Astra Honda Motor and previously in Thailand by A.P. Honda.The CBR150R was introduced by Honda as the successor to the 2-stroke NSR150. It has been sold in Thai market starting from 2002 and have been exported to many Asian countries and South Africa. A.P. Honda produces the new fuel-injected (PGM-FI) version in 2010, which has lower power than the carburetted version.[1] The design was shared with the 2011 CBR250R, which in turn borrows from VFR1200F sports tourer. The CBR150R went on sale in India in March 2012.[2] In 2014, Honda updated the CBR150R with the same body design as the CBR300R, which is inspired from the 2012 CBR1000RR. This update was applied to Indonesian market only, while other markets retained the old design. This model is also made locally by Astra Honda Motor.</p>
